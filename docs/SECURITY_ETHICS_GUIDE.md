## Introduction

Numira is designed with a "security and ethics first" approach. As a mental health application, we recognize our responsibility to:

- Protect sensitive user data
- Ensure safe and supportive AI interactions
- Detect and respond to potential crisis situations
- Maintain compliance with relevant regulations
- Prioritize user well-being above all else

This guide explains how these principles are implemented throughout the system.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-layered Security Approach

The Numira platform implements a multi-layered security architecture:

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks
2. **Content Moderation**: User-generated content is analyzed for harmful or inappropriate material
3. **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with proper token handling
4. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different system functions
5. **Data Encryption**: Data encrypted both in transit and at rest
6. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities
7. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
8. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events

### Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

- Content-Security-Policy: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- X-XSS-Protection: Additional XSS protection for older browsers
- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- Strict-Transport-Security: Enforces HTTPS connections
- Referrer-Policy: Controls information in the Referer header
- Permissions-Policy: Restricts browser feature usage

## Data Protection

### PHI and PII Protection

The system includes specialized detection and protection for:

- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Medical records, health conditions, treatment information
- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, SSNs

When such information is detected:

1. The user is warned about sharing sensitive information
2. The information is not stored in logs or analytics
3. The information is redacted from any stored content when necessary

### Data Minimization

We follow data minimization principles:

- Only collect information necessary for the service
- Provide options for anonymous usage where possible
- Implement configurable data retention policies
- Allow users to delete their data

## Ethical AI Framework

### Content Moderation

All user inputs are analyzed by our content moderation system to detect:

- Harmful or abusive language
- Self-harm or suicidal content
- Personally identifiable information
- Protected health information
- Content that could trigger distress

When concerning content is detected, the system can:

1. Block the content with an explanation
2. Trigger emergency protocols for crisis situations
3. Log the incident for review (without storing sensitive information)
4. Provide supportive resources to the user

### Bias Mitigation

The AI system includes measures to detect and mitigate potential biases:

- Regular auditing of AI responses for bias
- Diverse training data and prompt engineering
- Contextual awareness in different cultural settings
- User feedback mechanisms to report perceived bias

### Transparency

We maintain transparency about AI capabilities and limitations:

- Clear disclosure of AI-generated content
- Explanation of how user data influences AI responses
- Documentation of AI decision-making processes
- Regular updates on AI improvements and changes

## Crisis Detection and Response

### Crisis Detection

The system includes specialized detection for potential crisis situations:

- Suicidal ideation or self-harm indications
- Expressions of abuse or harm
- Emergency situations requiring immediate attention

### Response Protocols

When a potential crisis is detected, the system implements graduated response protocols:

1. **Low Severity**: Provide supportive resources and information
2. **Medium Severity**: Suggest professional help and provide crisis resources
3. **High Severity**: Provide immediate crisis resources and emergency contact information

### Crisis Resources

The system maintains up-to-date crisis resources including:

- Suicide prevention hotlines
- Crisis text lines
- Domestic violence resources
- Emergency services information
- Mental health resources

## Compliance Standards

The system is designed to comply with relevant standards and regulations:

- **HIPAA**: For health information protection
- **GDPR**: For data protection and privacy
- **CCPA/CPRA**: For California privacy requirements
- **PIPEDA**: For Canadian privacy requirements
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Configuration Options

Administrators can configure security and ethical parameters through environment variables:

```
# Security Configuration
ENABLE_XSS_PROTECTION=true
ENABLE_CONTENT_MODERATION=true
ENABLE_CRISIS_PROTOCOLS=true
ENABLE_SECURITY_HEADERS=true
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
ENABLE_PHI_DETECTION=true
ENABLE_PII_PROTECTION=true

# Ethical AI Configuration
AI_MODERATION_LEVEL=medium # Options: low, medium, high
AI_RESPONSE_FILTER=true
AI_CRISIS_DETECTION=true
AI_BIAS_MITIGATION=true
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. Use parameterized queries for database operations
3. Follow the principle of least privilege for access control
4. Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
5. Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
6. Use the content moderation middleware for all user-generated content
7. Implement proper logging that excludes sensitive information

### For Administrators

1. Regularly review security logs and audit trails
2. Implement proper access controls for administrative functions
3. Maintain up-to-date crisis resources
4. Configure appropriate security settings for your deployment
5. Conduct regular security assessments
6. Maintain a security incident response plan
7. Provide training on ethical AI usage and crisis response

By implementing these security and ethical measures, Numira aims to provide a safe, supportive environment that prioritizes user well-being while protecting sensitive information.
