## Background Job Processing System

Numira uses Bull, a Redis-based queue system, for processing background jobs. This allows the application to handle time-consuming tasks asynchronously, improving the user experience and application performance.

### Queue Types

- **Email Queue**: Handles sending emails for user notifications, reports, and system alerts
- **Report Queue**: Generates PDF reports for user activity, conversation insights, and system analytics
- **Cleanup Queue**: Performs routine cleanup tasks like removing old data, temporary files, and expired sessions
- **Notification Queue**: Manages push notifications for mobile and web clients

### Job Processors

Each queue has a dedicated processor that handles the specific job type:

- **emailProcessor.js**: Sends emails using Nodemailer
- **reportProcessor.js**: Generates PDF reports using PDFKit
- **cleanupProcessor.js**: Performs cleanup tasks for files, database records, and logs
- **notificationProcessor.js**: Sends push notifications using Web Push

### Scheduled Jobs

The system also supports scheduled jobs for recurring tasks:

- Daily backup at 2 AM
- Daily system check at 4 AM
- Weekly cleanup at 3 AM on Sundays

### Queue Monitoring

The Bull Board UI is available at `/admin/queues` for monitoring queue status, job progress, and errors.

## System Monitoring

Numira includes a comprehensive monitoring system to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

### Metrics API

The metrics API provides detailed information about system health and performance:

- **Public Metrics** (`/api/metrics`): Basic system status information
- **System Metrics** (`/api/metrics/system`): Detailed system information including CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Database Metrics** (`/api/metrics/database`): Database statistics and entity counts
- **AI Metrics** (`/api/metrics/ai`): AI usage statistics and costs
- **Queue Metrics** (`/api/metrics/queues`): Queue status and performance
- **Audit Metrics** (`/api/metrics/audit`): Audit log statistics
- **Summary** (`/api/metrics/summary`): Human-readable summary of system metrics

### Daily System Check

The system performs an automated health check daily at 4 AM that:

1. Collects comprehensive system metrics
2. Identifies potential issues based on predefined thresholds
3. Generates a detailed report
4. Sends email notifications to administrators when issues are detected
5. Stores reports in the database for historical analysis

This proactive monitoring helps identify and address issues before they impact users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v14 or higher)
- Redis (v6 or higher)
- OpenAI API key
- Git
- For mobile development:
  - Android Studio (for Android)
  - Xcode (for iOS, macOS only)
  - Capacitor CLI (`npm install -g @capacitor/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/byteworthy/Numira.git
cd Numira
```

2. Install server dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Install client dependencies
```
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `.env.sample`:
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.sample .env

# Edit the file with your own values
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

5. Seed the database with initial data (personas)
```
npm run seed
```

6. Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend server and the React frontend in development mode.
